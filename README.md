# CS3060_CPU_Scheduling
CPU scheduling algorithm simulator in C

This was built for a CS project in CS3060 at UVU meant to simulate how a CPU schedules cycle time using different methods: 
  
* First Come First Served
* Round Robin
* Shortest Job First
* Shortest Remaining Job First

## To Run:

CPUScheduling.c process-list.txt

process-list.txt is a file with lines containing a first value that represents what time the process arrives, and a second value that represents how much cpu time it will need to finish.
